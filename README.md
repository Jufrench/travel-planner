# Travel Planner

A responsive web tool that allows users to add trips by selecting a destination and departure date. The trips are automatically sorted by departure date. Weather data will be displayed for each trip. If the departure date is more than 8 days away, a 16 day forcast will be presented, otherwise the weather data will be the current weather.
